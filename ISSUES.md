#Issues
**Comparing what i did Swift with PyTorch**

1- Image Preprocessing: 
PyTorch: The image is assumed to be preprocessed before being passed to the model. 
Swift: resizing the image to 256x256, which matches the PyTorch input size (not 300x300 here). 
But, we need to make sure weâ€™re doing the exact same color space conversions and normalizations that were done during PyTorch training. 

**Model Inference:**

PyTorch: Model output is calculated as `out = model(example_input)` 
Swift: calling `model.prediction(input: input)`. 
Both are equivalent in terms of inference. 

**Post-processing (Softmax & Top 3 Classes):**

PyTorch: applying `torch.exp(out)` to convert the output to probabilities, then selecting the top 3 classes and their probabilities. 
Swift: also correctly applying softmax (`let exps = array.map { exp($0) }`) and selecting the top 3 classes (`classProbabilities = Array(classProbabilities.prefix(3))`). 

Also, one main difference, and potential issue, might be in the way the image is transformed from a CVPixelBuffer to an MLMultiArray. 
In the Swift code, I think that the image data in the CVPixelBuffer is in a specific format (RGB, 256x256). 
If the PyTorch training code used a different format like BGR or different normalization, we might encounter contradiction.
